## Current Update (October 2, 2024)
Since this website is not used to write blogs by myself due to unrelated reasons, I am thinking of auto-generating blog by an AI model along with AI generated image. Every day a new blog is going to be posted by AI automatically.
- **AI model** : Not sure, maybe claude
- **Agentic AI framework** : Autogen
- **Image Generation** : Pollinations.ai and stable-diffusion
- **Task Management** : Celery
- **Message Broker**: Redis as of now, might change to RabbitMQ later
