## Update (October 2, 2024)
Since this website is not used to write blogs by myself due to unrelated reasons, I am thinking of auto-generating blog by an AI model along with AI-generated image. Every day a new blog is going to be posted by AI automatically.
- **AI model**: Not sure, maybe Claude
- **Image Generation**: Pollinations.ai and stable-diffusion
- **Task Management**: Celery
- **Message Broker**: Redis as of now, might change to RabbitMQ later

## Update (October 19, 2024)
The project is now automated to generate and post travel blogs daily using AI. This allows consistent content posting without manual input.

- **AI Model**: Currently using Google Generative AI for blog generation.
- **Image Generation**: Using Pollinations.ai and Stable Diffusion to generate AI-powered images for each post.
- **Task Management**: Celery handles the periodic tasks of generating and posting blogs.
- **Message Broker**: Redis is being used to manage the task queues for Celery.

With this automation, the blog remains active and regularly updated with fresh content!

## Update (November 30, 2024)
Taking the blog project a step further, an AI avatar feature will be integrated to enhance user interaction. Users will be able to click on a blog post to have it recited by an AI avatar in either Nepali or English.

### AI Avatar Features
- **Recitation Option**: Users can choose to have the blog recited in Nepali or English.
- **Translation**: The blog content is translated from English to Nepali using a Generative AI model.
- **Voice Synthesis**: Googleâ€™s GTTS (Google Text-to-Speech) will be used to generate high-quality voice outputs.
- **Avatar Rendering**: The AI avatar is rendered using React Three Fiber.
- **Avatar Design**: The base design of the avatar will be created using Ready Player Me, with custom modifications made in Blender.
- **Avatar's Lipsync**: Although, I am still figuring out and testing options, at first I will be using ["rhubarb-lip-sync"](https://github.com/DanielSWolf/rhubarb-lip-sync) which is a really cool project.

With this feature, the travel blog will not only provide engaging content but also an immersive and interactive user experience.

## Update (January 15, 2025)
The project now has an AI avatar which recites the blog contents for you!

- **Recitation Option**: Users can choose to have the blog recited in Nepali or English.
- **In Avatar Options**: Users can select play/pause and reset option for respective performation of avatar.
- **In the html page**: A fully responsive sidebar is shown which includes the avatar when selected an language. Options to minimize and maximixe the avatar in mobile view..

### Future:
- A better translator will be used for translation of blog contents to nepali.
- Currently used Google's TTS is not perfect so, a better and flexible tts will be used.

**(Note: Only blogs written by the "automatic blog writer" has ability to show AI avatars but later it will be available for user written blogs as well.)**
